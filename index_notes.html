            <p>Let me tell you how:</p>
                <ol> <!--orderder list will not have as much inbetween spacing as a paragraph <p>-->
                    <li>...I learn more about web dev. </li>
                    <li>...I plan out my schedule.</li>
                    <li>...I use resources from <abbr title="Mozilla Devolper Network">
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a>
                    </abbr>.</li> <!--This href has the full website address so it is an absolute reference-->
                </ol>
        </section>
      
            <!-- **Commented out from previous example: This was how we set up the breaks, an html entity, and abreviaitons previously:
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...I learn more about web dev. Example of an html entity, The entities are used to do special formating, &nbsp; adds a space
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...I plan out my schedule.
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...I use resources from <abbr title="Mozilla Devolper Network">MDN</abbr>. 
                The abbr HTML entity doesnt work by itself. A title attribute must also be set. Now the HTML will have dots under the MDN text. When the user scrolls over the MDN text it will show them the full title. *THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR SCREEN READERS SO NOTHING SUPER IMPORTANT SHOULD BE HERE*
